We bring in new Featured Artists every week, but it's rare to add **100+** tracks in one go. That's what we're doing today with **UNTONE Sound Group**!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/xxx/header.jpg)

**UNTONE Sound Group** is made up of two music labels: [**UNTONE Music**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/479) and [**TONE::FURY**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/480). The first supports songs from any genre, while the second is specifically focused on hard dance music. 

Both are officially part of osu! with...

- **140 tracks** on [**UNTONE Music**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/479)
- **22 tracks** on [**TONE::FURY**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/480)

At this scale, it's pretty unrealistic for us to showcase *everything* that the labels have to offer. Instead, we've set up a preview showcasing snippets of 10 different tracks in the video below, plus a couple tracks with Ranked maps to play through:
