You learned about artcore from rhythm games, and our latest Featured Artist is here to offer more.

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/xxx/header.jpg)

A connoisseur of orchestral sounds and electronica, **SPIRIT GARDEN \*** is a German producer responsible for awakening a new era of artcore in the doujin music scene. Inspired by icons like [*ak+q*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/466) and *AcuticNotes*, **SPIRIT GARDEN \***'s sound takes elements from the past and morphs them with a modern take on the artcore subgenre.

**4** diverse tracks are permanently housed on [**SPIRIT GARDEN \***'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/489), and once you're done with them, they'll also be housed in the Ranked section.

Preview these tunes for yourself:
