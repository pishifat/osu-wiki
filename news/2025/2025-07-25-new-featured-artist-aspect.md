**Aspect**'s music isn't what you'd expect to hear from a rhythm game, but sometimes that's what osu! needs.

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/xxx/header.jpg)

A specialist in narrative-driven electronic/orchestral songs, **Aspect** focuses his music on worldbuilding in service of a story he's been developing for nearly a decade. 

With a grander goal in mind, **Aspect**'s tracks often feature foley and sound design that you wouldn't find in most music, providing a refreshing take on ordinary electronic tracks. 

Snippets of **Aspect**'s story can be revealed through the **9** tracks on [his Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/xxx), each pre-timed so you can immediately bring them to life with circles, sliders, drums, fruits, keys, and whatever else exists.

If **Aspect**'s experiments resonate with you, you know what to do:

[**Aspect**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/xxx) has even more tracks to choose from. If you have some free time at [cavoe's osu! event](/wiki/Community/cavoe's_osu!_event), you're in the perfect place to learn how to map directly from other mappers.

If you couldn't make it to COE this year, at least you can look forward to a new Featured Artist announcement next weekend!
